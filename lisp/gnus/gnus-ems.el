    ;; Mule and new Emacs definitions

    ;; [Note] Now there are three kinds of mule implementations,
    ;; original MULE, XEmacs/mule and Emacs 20+ including
    ;; MULE features.  Unfortunately these APIs are different.  In
    ;; particular, Emacs (including original Mule) and XEmacs are
    ;; quite different.  However, this version of Gnus doesn't support
    ;; anything other than XEmacs 20+ and Emacs 20.3+.

    ;; Predicates to check are following:
    ;; (boundp 'MULE) is t only if Mule (original; anything older than
    ;;                     Mule 2.3) is running.
    ;; (featurep 'mule) is t when other mule variants are running.

    ;; It is possible to detect XEmacs/mule by (featurep 'mule) and
    ;; (featurep 'xemacs).  In this case, the implementation for
    ;; XEmacs/mule may be shareable between XEmacs and XEmacs/mule.
